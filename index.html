    <h2>Book Summary: law of human nature </h2>
   <big><p>Author: Robert greene

        The **law of human nature** is the idea that all humans have an inherent understanding of right and wrong, independent of culture, upbringing, or education. It is not a law written in books or enforced by authorities but a moral compass found within every person. This natural law suggests that people across the world, regardless of background, recognize concepts like fairness, justice, and honesty. For example, when someone is treated unfairly, they instinctively feel wronged—even if they’ve never been taught about fairness.
        
        Philosophers like **C.S. Lewis** argued that this inner moral law is evidence of a higher moral order or divine truth. He explained that while we may not always follow the law of human nature, we are aware of when we break it. This awareness shows that it's more than social custom—it's deeply rooted in human nature.
        
        The law also goes beyond simple survival or evolution. While animals act on instinct, humans often go against self-interest to help others or stand up for justice. This moral sense encourages people to be honest, kind, and selfless, even when it's not personally rewarding.
        
        Although different cultures may express morals differently, the core values—like the wrongness of murder or the importance of keeping promises—remain consistent. This universality supports the idea that the law of human nature is part of what makes us human. It plays a vital role in ethics, law, religion, and personal behavior, guiding individuals and societies toward a more just and moral world.
